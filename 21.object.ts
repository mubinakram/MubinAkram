PROBLEM:

// They think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object.
//  Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.


let person: { name: string; age: number; city: string } = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
};

// Access properties of the person object
console.log(person.name); 
console.log(person.age);  
console.log(person.city); 

OUTPUT:
Alice
30
New York
